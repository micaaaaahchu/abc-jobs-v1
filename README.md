# ABC-Jobs-Portal-First-Version
Project Title: Design, Develop, Implement & Document Community Portal Website

Project Background
ABC Jobs Pte Ltd approached me to develop a community portal for software developers, and this project will span several modules, including Module 3, Module 4, Module 5, and the Capstone project. In this particular module, my main focus is on designing, developing, implementing, and documenting a Spring website that meets the project scope.

The scope of the project is to create a community portal that is similar to LinkedIn.com. Users will be able to register on the portal using a registration page and search for other users using various parameters such as first name, last name, company name, city, and country.
Once users have searched for other users, they will be able to view the public profiles of these users. The portal will allow users to log in, request forgotten passwords, and update their profile information as well.

Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design, develop, implement, and document a Spring website that serves as the foundation of a community portal for software developers. The community portal will be similar to LinkedIn.com, where users can register using a registration page, search for other users using various parameters such as first name, last name, company name, city, and country, and view the public profiles of other users. Additionally, the portal will allow users to log in, retrieve forgotten passwords, and update their profile information.
